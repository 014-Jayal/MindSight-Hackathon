## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run **MindSight** on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/014-Jayal/MindSight-Hackathon
cd MindSight-Hackathon
```

Or download the ZIP and extract it manually.

---

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a **virtual environment** to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

When activated, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This may take several minutes since large libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) will be installed.

---

### 4. Download spaCy Language Model

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

### 5. Set Google Gemini API Key

The AI Companion requires a **Google Gemini API Key**.

- Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
- Set it as an **environment variable** (do not hardcode in code).

```powershell
# On Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

```

⚠️ **Note:** You’ll need to set this variable each time you open a new terminal.

---

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser 🎉
